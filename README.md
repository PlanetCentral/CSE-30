# CSE-30 Homework Assignments

## Usage

Repository for CSE-30 Homework Assignments. In order to ensure the successful compilation and running of these Jupyter Notebooks, follow these instructions clearly:
1. Download Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download) NOT standard Python. Other distributions may work, but Anaconda includes the necessary extensions needed for full code compilation.
2. Have an IDE to open and interpret Jupyter (.ipynb) files. Visual Studio Code is lightweight and works well. If using VSCode, ensure you have the necessary Python extensions installed. It's very straightforward.
3. Open and examine the notebooks after downloading. Do NOT copy the code! You WILL not learn and will most likely be flagged for cheating!
